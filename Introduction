The major challenge for the VLSI designer is area, performance, cost and power consumption. In Mobile , IOT dommains increasingly power consumption is being given comparable weight
to area and speed considerations as these are battery dependant . Today power is the primary focus  for the competing market in IOT era  and success in the field of personal computing devices,  telecommunication  system  which  demand  high  speed  
computation  and  complex  functionality  with  low  power consumption is has been the prime agenda for these markets. The  motivation  for    power  consumption  reduction  differ  from application  to  application.  In  the  class  of  micro-powered  battery-  operated,  portable  applications,  such  as  cellular  phones  and personal digital assistants, 
the goal is to keep the battery lifetime and weight reasonable and low  packaging cost .
